## üöÄ Local Development Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up and running this project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.10 or newer)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-directory-name>
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend (FastAPI)

You will need a terminal to run the backend server.

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    This project requires API keys to connect to external services.
    *   In the `backend` folder, find the file named `.env.example`.
    *   Make a copy of this file and rename the copy to `.env`.
    *   Open the new `.env` file and add your personal API keys:
        ```env
        OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
        ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key_here"
        GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
        ```
    > **Important:** The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and should never be committed to the repository.

3.  **Create virtual Environment**
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```cmd
        python -m venv .venv
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv .venv
        ```

4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```cmd
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

5.  **Install Dependencies and Run the Server**
    ```bash
    # Install the required Python packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Start the backend development server
    uvicorn src.app:app --reload
    ```
    Note that the command points to `src.app:app` because the main FastAPI instance (`app`) is located in the `backend/src/app.py` file.

The backend API is now running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Keep this terminal open.

### 3. Set Up the Frontend (React)

**Open a new, separate terminal window.** This is required to run the frontend and backend servers simultaneously.

In the new terminal, follow these steps:
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory from the project root
cd frontend

# Install the required Node.js packages
npm install

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
```
The React application is now running and accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

### All Set!

You should now have both the backend API and the frontend application running locally. Changes you make to the code will cause the respective servers to automatically reload.
