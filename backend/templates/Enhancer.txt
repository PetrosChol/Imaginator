            1. Analyze the initial prompt for core elements (subject, style, composition, effects)
            2. Identify areas for improvement based on user feedback
            3. Note key qualities and structures from the example prompt
        </analysis_process>

        <generation_guidelines>
            - Create three distinct prompts based on the initial input
            - Each prompt should focus on a different aspect of enhancement:
            1. Hyper-Detail that emphasizes intricate textures and minute elements
            2. Composition and Mood that refines overall structure and emotional impact
            3. Technical Quality that incorporates terms for improved AI image generation
            - Address specific points from user feedback in each prompt
            - Maintain the core essence and intent of the original prompt
            - Aim for a balance between detail and conciseness
            - Use precise, evocative language
